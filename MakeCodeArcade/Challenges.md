# Challenges
Complete any of the following challenges that seem interesting.

## Basic Challenges
These challenges are fairly basic, so they are a good starting point.

### Basic 1: Add a New Background Image
In the "Scene" category, there is a `set background image` block. Drag it into the `on start` block, and click the blank spot to open the Background Image Editor!

### Basic 2: Create a New Tilemap
Edit the tilemap to make a new challenge for the player! To make a longer level, update the horizontal size of the tilemap.

### Basic 3: Change the Jump Height
Find the code that makes the main character jump, and figure out how to jump higher!

### Basic 4: Add a Countdown
In the "Info" category, there is a `start countdown` block. Drag it into the `on start` block to add a countdown to the game. When the countdown reaches zero, the player will lose! Update the length of the countdown so the game is still winnable.

### Basic 5: Add a Startup Melody
In the "Music" category, there is a `play melody` block. Drag it into the `on start` block to add a melody that plays before the game begins! Click the blank music section to create the melody, or choose from the gallery of existing melodies. Set the tempo too!

## Other Challenges
These challenges are separate from the platformer game, but they are related to retro game development.

### Other 1: Piskel
[Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) is a website that lets artists create pixel art! It is free to use, and it can be a lot of fun to design sprites and animations.

Visit the website and look at some of the examples, or click "Create Sprite" to start creating a sprite.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMkvVmAQBd0) and the other videos in the series can be helpful to get started making pixel art with Piskel.

### Other 2: More MakeCode Arcade Tutorials
MakeCode Arcade has a bunch of great [tutorials](https://arcade.makecode.com/tutorials) for all types of retro games!

Visit the website to explore some of the possibilities.

### Other 3: Whatever!
Add some completely different stuff to the platformer game, or create an entirely new game! Almost anything is possible; it's all about learning how to do it.

## Advanced Challenges
These challenges are a little more advanced, so they can be fairly difficult!

### Advanced 1: Update the Main Character Sprite Animation
Update the frames of the main character sprite animation! Start by opening the [Animated Game](https://makecode.com/_3wXbAr715Myi), and click the "Edit Code" button at the top.

For the new template, find the `Main Character Image` variables and update each of them.

### Advanced 2: Add Background Music

1. From the "Loops" category, drag a `forever` block into the **Code** section
1. In the "Music" category, drag a `play melody` block ito the `forever` block

This will make the melody repeat forever!

### Advanced 3: Add a Points System
Create a way to track points in the game.

1. In the "Info" category, click and drag a `set score to 0` block into the `on start` block
1. Edit the tilemap to add a new type of tile that will give the character a point (a coin, a star, a ring, something like that)
1. From the "Scene" category, drag an `on sprite of kind player overlaps` block to the **Code** section
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to `overlaps` and select the point up tile
1. In the "Info" category, click and drag a `change score by 1` block into the new `overlaps` block
1. In the "Scene" category, under Tiles, click and drag a `set [] at tilemap` block into the new `overlaps` block
1. Click and drag the `location` from the `overlaps` block into where the `tilemap` coordinates are

### Advanced 4: Add an Infinite Jump Power-up
A lot of this is very similar to the points system - adding a new tile to the tilemap, and making something happen when the main character overlaps it. The new part is the `Infinite Jump` variable. The `Infinite Jump` variable will be either `true` or `false` - it will change based on the gameplay.

1. In the "Variables" category, click the "Make a variable..." button to make a new variable named `Infinite Jump`
1. Drag a `set mySprite to 0` block into the `on start` block
1. Change `mySprite` to `Infinite Jump`
1. In the `Logic` section, scroll down to find the `<false>` block and drag it into the `0` in the `set Infinite Jump to` block
    - This means that `Infinite Jump` will be turned off to start the game
1. Edit the tilemap to add a new type of tile that will give the player a power-up (a mushroom, a flower, a cherry, something like that)
1. From the "Scene" category, drag an `on sprite of kind player overlaps` block to the **Code** section
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to `overlaps` and select the power-up tile
1. From the "Variables" category, drag a `set mySprite to 0` block into the `overlaps` block, but make it set `Infinite Jump` to `<true>`
1. In the "Scene" category, under Tiles, click and drag a `set [] at tilemap` block into the new `overlaps` block
1. Click and drag the `location` from the `overlaps` block into where the `tilemap` coordinates are
1. In the jump code, drag an `< or >` block from the "Logic" category into the `if` block
1. For one side of the `or`, drag back the `is Main Character hitting wall bottom` block
1. For the other side, drag in the `Infinite Jump` block from the "Variables" category

Now, the main character can jump if they are on the ground _or_ `Infinite Jump` has been enabled by the power-up!
